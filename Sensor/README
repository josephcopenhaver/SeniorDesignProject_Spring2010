Team 3 WLAN SENSOR README:

To use our module, you must first create a new object instance of our handler:

   WLANHandler wh(<MAC>, <IP>, <SERVERPORT>);

Once the handler object has been created, then you can call the main interface functions of the object:

   wh.queueString(<string_to_deliver>); [void]
   wh.lock(); [void]
   wh.getModeType(); [int]
   wh.getModeVal(); [int]
   wh.unlock(); [void]


The handler object must be locked when calling:

   wh.getModeType();
   wh.getModeVal();

The lock() operation prevents the listener thread from setting the contents
when a mode change is received. This means that the space between lock()
and unlock() statements should be minmal to let the listener run at full
capacity.

----------------

To allow our program to start automatically, place the file S70sensor in /etc/init.d
You will need to edit it to change the path where it looks for the sensor program.
If it doesn't seem to work, try changing the priority by changing the 70 to a different number
